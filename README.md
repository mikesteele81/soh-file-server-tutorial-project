School of Haskell File Server Tutorial Project
==============================================

This repository contains the source code for a tutorial series hosted on the
[School of Haskell][0]. The first commit corresponds to where [parts 1-4][1]
left off. Each additional commit corresponds to a single working step starting
with [part 5][2]. By convention, branch names are of the form "AA-BB" where AA
is a number representing a numbered article in the series and "BB" is a number
that increments with each working code sample.

The easiest way to get started is to [clone this repository][3] in the FP
Haskell Center. If you wish to follow along, checkout the "05-00" branch as
you begin reading [the tutorial][2].

Be advised that this repository is "live". Published branches will be
retroactively modified as corrections or updates are made.
